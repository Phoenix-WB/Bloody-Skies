# Bloody Skies Mod

# Items:
- Tecpatl; A tool made from quartz and Crimson Ichor, ideal for sacrifical purposes. Whilst a villager is sleeping, you can approach sneaking, and right click on the villager to sacrifice it in order to retrieve its heart. Keep in mind, this item is single use.
- Crimson Ichor: A material of blood harvested of the Clot Lilies native to the Sanguine Scapes.
- Villager Heart: You are truly evil, if you wish to fulfill your desires, take this to a Blood Altar.

# Blocks:
- Bloodstone: Has no technical functionality, and requires an iron pickaxe to mine and retrieve. Used for aesthetic design in the new biome added.
- Clot Lily: Similarly used for aesthetic design, and drops Crimson Ichor upon harvesting.
- Blood Altar: A structure forged of stone and Crimson Ichor, place a Villager Heart upon its pedestal to receive a few boosts intended for construction and mining purposes, including prevention of mob spawns within a small radius, similar to a beacon, but with few key differences.

# Entities:
- Bloodjaw: A menacing beast that roams the Sanguine Scapes, they hunt in packs, and are inclined to tear you to pieces. These creatures will not drop anything, so avoid picking a fight, and watch your back...

# Biomes:
- Sanguine Scapes: A land of blood and despair. Any entity will rapidly decay in this environment during the daytime, and as such it is strictly advised only to enter at night, if one wishes to collect Clot Lilies for Crimson Ichor. However, you must be cautious at this time, due to the Bloodjaws prowling through the bones and fleshy remains of this twisted place, good luck.
