# Bloody Skies Mod

# Items:
- Tecpatl; A tool made from quartz and Crimson Ichor, ideal for sacrifical purposes. Whilst a villager is sleeping, you can approach sneaking, and right click on the villager to sacrifice it in order to retrieve its heart. Keep in mind, this item is single use.
- Crimson Ichor: A material of blood harvested of the Clot Lilies native to the Sanguine Scapes.
- Stained Silk: A string-like material imbued with crimson ichor.
- Villager Heart: You are truly evil, if you wish to fulfill your desires, take this to a Blood Altar.
- Blood Cloth: Sewn together from Stained Silk, place upon a pedestal to harness the lifeforce of a Villager Heart.

# Blocks:
- Bloodstone: Has no technical functionality, and requires an iron pickaxe to mine and retrieve. Used for aesthetic design in the new biome added.
- Clot Lily: Flowers found subsisting on the blood running through the Sanguine Scapes, drops Crimson Ichor upon harvesting.
- Pedestal: A stone structure fit to hold the power of the Sanguine Scapes.
- Blood Altar: A structure forged of stone and Crimson Ichor, place a Villager Heart upon its pedestal to receive a few boosts intended for construction and mining purposes, including prevention of mob spawns within a small radius.

# Entities:
- Bloodjaw: A menacing beast that roams the Sanguine Scapes, they hunt in packs, and are inclined to tear you to pieces. These creatures will not drop anything, so avoid picking a fight, and watch your back...

# Biomes:
- Sanguine Scapes: A land of blood and despair. Any entity will rapidly decay in this environment during the daytime, and as such it is strictly advised only to enter at night, if one wishes to collect Clot Lilies for Crimson Ichor. However, you must be cautious at this time, due to the Bloodjaws prowling through the bones and fleshy remains of this twisted place, good luck.
